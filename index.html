			<h2 class="headColor" id="L1">What's New</h2>
			<p class="ex1">The following are enhancements/new features in the product organized into the different
				modules of RecVue.</p>

			<h3 class="headColor" id="L2">Customer Price Index (CPI)</h3>

			<p class="ex1"><b class="headColor">CPI for MLM</b>: CPI compatibility has now been extended to Multi Line
				Minimum product lines, just like it has for recurring and usage products. As a result, the application
				has been enhanced as follows.</P>
			<ul>
				<li>Provided the CPI tab in the sub-tab menu of the billing tab in the MLM Product Line UI.</li>
				<li>Supports the price uplift of MLM lines.<br><br>
					<img src="./Image1.png" width=884 height=413;>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="ex1"><b class="headColor">CPI Audit Report</b>: Provided a separate report called 'CPI Audit
				Report' to view all previous CPI transactions' details. The CPI Audit Details report option has been
				added to the Actions button in the Product Line UI.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>It will be displayed in a separate window.</li>
				<li>It contains columns such as the action, audit date, order number, adjustment type, line number,
					column name, and product name.</li>
				<li>Provides an Excel file download option in your local system explorer.<br><br>
					<img src="./Image2.png" width=884 height=413;>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="headColor" ID="L5">Asset-as-a-Service</h3>

			<p class="ex1">RecVue enhanced with the Asset-as-a-Service (AaaS) feature. 'With this, an asset rule may be
				defined against an asset (such as equipment, machinery, containers, vehicles, etc.). Charges will be
				generated for movement depending on the specification of the asset rule. For more details, please
				contact the RecVue support team.</p>

			<h3 class="headColor" id="L6">Billing Management</h3>

			<p class="ex1"><b class="headColor">Exclude from Billing</b>: Provided an option that users can skip
				specific orders or product lines from the billing. The 'Do not Bill' checkbox has been added to the
				Billing Details tab screen in both the Product Line UI and Order Header UI. To exclude a specific order
				or line, the user must select this option. To exclude a specific order or line, the user must select
				this option.</p>

			<p class="ex1">Refer to the image for the <b>‘Do not Bill’</b> option in the Order Header UI:<br><br>
				<img src="./Image3.png" width=884 height=413;>
			</p>

			<p class="ex1">Refer to the image below for the <b>‘Do not Bill’</b> option in the Product Line UI:<br><br>
				<img src="./Image4.png" width=884 height=413;>
			</p>


			<p class="ex1"><b class="headColor">MLM - Event Hold</b>: Previously, the parent line of Multi-Line Minimum
				[MLM] could not create billing schedules if one of its associated lines was applied to an event hold
				until the hold was lifted.</p>

			<p class="ex1">Now the MLM parent line can still create billing schedules even if one of its associated
				lines is applied to an event hold. It skips the specific child line that is on event hold and creates
				billing schedules for the remaining lines. Provided a profile option to use this option. For more
				information, please contact the RecVue support team.</p>

			<p class="ex1"><b class="headColor">MLM Overage</b>: In the Product Line UI, provided a MLM Overage
				checkbox. If the user selects the checkbox, the MLM will be considered as maximum threshold amount. Each
				month the billing amount of child lines is less than the MLM threshold nothing will be billed, or else,
				the delta amount will be billed.<br><br>
				<img src="./Image5.png" width=884 height=413;>
			</p>

			<h3 class="headColor" id="L10">Partner Settlement</h3>

			<p class="ex1"><b class="headColor">Payable Manual Adjustments Report</b>: Recent releases introduced the
				payment adjustments function to create manual debit and credit memos. In this release, we added the
				'Payable Manual Adjustments' report, which provides data on credit and debit memos
				based on business units. To generate the report, the "Payable Manual Adjustments" report tile was added
				to the Reports UI. <br><br>
				<img src="./Image6.png" width=884 height=413;>
			</p>

			<p class="ex1"><b class="headColor">Payment Adjustments</b>: In the Adjustments UI, the following two
				buttons are added:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><u class="headColor">Submit</u>: It is useful to pick several adjustments and submit them all at
					once.</li>
				<li><u class="headColor">Delete</u>: It is useful to delete bulk adjustments that are in draft status
					with a single click.
				</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="ex1"><b class="headColor"> Asset Re-Numbering</b>: The asset module now supports renumbering the
				asset and making payments accordingly. Renumbering means the unique identifier for the asset, which is
				EQPD (equipment ID and external field), and API-KEY (internal field), are changed to another set of
				values. This is tracked via asset versioning.</p>

			<p class="ex1">A few changes occurred in the following UIs. For more details, please contact the RecVue
				support team.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Fulfilments</li>

				<li>Paid Amount</li>
				<li>Invoices’ Amount</li>
			</ul>

			<h3 class="headColor" id="L11">Revenue Management</h3>

			<p class="ex1">Reports are generating currently based on order ID, users have the option to provide a single
				order number. We have now provided a multi-select option in the order ID field to generate a report for
				multiple orders. <br><br>

			</p>

			<h3 class="headColor" id="L12">Others</h3>

					ID, User First Name, and User Last Name. <br><br>

				</li>
				<li>The user-specific field `Event Type' (Line Tax Code) available in the Billing tab (Billing
					Term screen) of the Product Line UI now also appears as one of the list options values in the
					advanced search of the Order Search UI on the line level. It shows the LOV values of the event type
					field in a separate column where the user can use the filter option and download the details in an
					Excel or CSV file.
